# ue.el
## Synopsis

**ue** is a minor mode for working with [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/) projects in GNU Emacs in conjunction with [Unreal Emacs plug-in](https://gitlab.com/manenko/emacs-sourcecode-access).
Internally it is based on [Projectile](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile).

It means that you can use Projectile's commands for greping (or acking) files, switching between alternating files, etc.

Compilation and running is not available yet but will be added in the future. This is a work-in-progress project, which means there are a lot of things to do.

## Features

1. Syntax highlighting for Unreal attributes (`UCLASS`, `USTRUCT`, etc.) and `GENERATED_*BODY` macro.
2. Project navigation through `projectile`.
3. Unreal Engine code snippets
4. TBD

## Setup

### Installation

The project is not yet released so it is not available on any of Emacs repositories, which means you have to install it manually.

#### Manual

TBD (In-Progress)

## Usage

### The global mode

Use the package as a global mode:

```el
(require 'ue)

(ue-global-mode)
```

That will turn on the local `ue-mode` for the buffers which belong to an Unreal Engine projects generated by .

Probably you should read Projectile's [README](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile) on setting up the completion system,
caching and indexing files.

## Caveats

TBD
